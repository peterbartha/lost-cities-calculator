# Lost Cities Score Calculator

> Set out on expeditions üõï, but will your findings outweigh the cost of each adventure? ü§†

[Lost Cities](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/50/lost-cities) by the world-renowned board-game author Reiner
Knizia takes you on a journey to undiscovered countries and mythical places.

Two explorers embark on research journeys to remote corners of the world: the Himalayan mountains, the Central American rainforest, the Egyptian desert, a mysterious volcano, and the bottom of the sea. As the cards are played, the expedition routes take shape and the explorers earn points. The most daring adventurers make bets on the success of their expeditions. The explorer with the highest score after three rounds of expeditions wins. The rules of the game are simple, but beware: The lost cities hold many unseen mysteries! This new edition features a sixth set of expedition cards and a two-sided game board: On one side is the classic five-expedition game. On the other side, a new variant with six expeditions is offered.

## Why do we need a calculator?

The motivation behind this microsite is that I wanted to simplify the score calculations after every game, because it can sometimes be tricky. This online calculator makes the scoring quick and easy, so you'll have more time to enjoy the fun part and play another party.

_‚Äû...Another calculator?!‚Äù_ \
There are a half-dozen calculator on the web, some are still working, some are already broken. Unfortunately, I cannot find a functional variant that supports the 6th expedition version, has a relatively good UX, and also works on mobile devices. \
Moreover, this is a great opportunity to learn [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), because before this project I had no expertise in it. So this is my "mini hacking project" exploring [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

## Available functions

- Calculate points for each deck
- Set player names and save it for later use
- Show score calculation details
- Support the newer variant of the game (i.e. the 6th expedition)
- Mobile / tablet support
